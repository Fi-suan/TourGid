Over 25 years, Astana has turned into an ultramodern metropolis with unique architecture, an international political and business center. In 2019-2022, the city was called Nur-Sultan.

Aktau became the only city in the world to be fully supplied with desalinated water from the Caspian Sea.

Today Aktau is the administrative center of Mangystau Region, an important transport and logistics hub, center of oil production and tourism with unique natural landscapes."
